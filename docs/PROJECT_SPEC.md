# Home Hub — Project Spec

> A personal command center that runs your apartment — lights, music, routines — learns how you live, and comes alive for the moments that matter.

## Vision

Home Hub is an always-on personal command center built for one apartment and one person. It controls Philips Hue lights and a Sonos Era 100 speaker from a single, visually striking dashboard that's always running on a dedicated laptop display. The system is deeply integrated into daily life — it detects what you're doing, adjusts lighting and music to match, and learns your patterns over time until it can run on full autopilot.

The dashboard isn't a boring control panel. It's a living interface with bold, mode-aware animated backgrounds — arcade birds drifting across the screen during relax mode, a rotating moon over a darkening city while sleeping, energy and motion during gaming. It shows everything at a glance: current mode, light colors, now playing, weather, upcoming routines. It's also a hub for other personal projects (plant tracking app, future bar app) with animated widget cards that link out to each one.

The core focus is getting lights and music working seamlessly. Everything else builds on that foundation — voice control via Alexa, game day celebrations for the Colts, and an intelligence layer that observes everything (mode changes, manual overrides, music choices, light adjustments, routine interactions) and gradually takes over.

## Goals

- **Lights and music first** — These are the foundation. Everything else builds on getting light control and mode-aware music playback working flawlessly
- **Always-on command center** — Runs 24/7 on a dedicated foldable laptop (1080p landscape), always displaying the dashboard. Also works cleanly on mobile
- **Invisible automation** — The system detects activity, adjusts lights and music, and manages routines without manual input. Gradual transitions, activity-aware timing
- **Full autopilot learning** — Observes all interactions and behavior patterns, starts with simple rules ("Friday 8pm = gaming"), evolves toward autonomous decision-making with subtle nudge notifications
- **Bold, living UI** — Animated backgrounds that change with mode and time of day. Not a generic dashboard — a visual experience that reflects what's happening in the apartment
- **Voice control** — Alexa integration (Fauxmo locally first, custom skill later) for hands-free mode switching, music control, and routine triggers
- **Game day magic** — Colts games become a synchronized experience: lights, sound, TTS celebrations, live scoreboard, pixel art field
- **Hub for everything** — Widget cards for plant app, future bar app, and other projects. The dashboard is the home screen for your digital life
- **Personal, not generic** — Every rule, mode, animation, and routine is tuned for one person's actual apartment and habits

## Current State

### Lighting

- Full Philips Hue control via dual APIs (v1/phue2 for basic control + 1s polling, CLIP v2 for native scenes and dynamic effects)
- Time-based automation: wake, daytime, evening, night periods with separate weekday/weekend schedules
- Activity-driven modes: gaming, working, watching, relax, movie, social — each with per-light state definitions
- Native Hue scenes and dynamic effects (candlelight, fireplace, sparkle, prism, glisten, opal)
- Social mode sub-styles (color cycle, theater, party)
- Screen sync for gaming (bedroom lamp mirrors dominant screen color via mss capture)
- Manual override with 4-hour auto-timeout
- Configurable per-mode brightness multipliers

### Audio & Music

- Sonos Era 100 control: play/pause, volume, next/prev, favorites
- Mode-to-playlist mapping — each activity mode can auto-play a Sonos favorite
- Smart auto-play: plays mapped favorite when Sonos is idle on mode change, suggests via toast if busy
- Apple Music library import with taste profile generation (genre distribution, top artists)
- Music discovery via Last.fm similar artists + iTunes Search 30s previews
- Recommendation feedback system (like/dismiss with scoring)
- TTS via edge-tts with duck-and-resume (pauses music, plays speech, resumes)

### Automation

- PC activity detection (psutil process monitoring for games/media)
- Ambient noise monitoring (Blue Yeti mic RMS for party detection)
- Mode priority system: gaming (5) > social (4) > watching (3) > working (2) > idle (1) > away (0)
- Morning routine: weather (OpenWeatherMap) + commute (Google Maps) TTS at configurable time
- Evening wind-down: dims lights, activates candlelight, lowers volume, TTS announcement
- All routine config persisted to SQLite, hot-reloadable

### Dashboard

- Three pages: Home (controls), Music (discovery + mapping), Settings (configuration)
- Real-time WebSocket sync — changes from Alexa, Hue app, or physical switches reflected instantly
- PWA-capable for phone/tablet kiosk mode
- Optimistic updates for responsive feel
- Music suggestion toasts on mode change

### Known Issues & Pain Points

**Automation timing:**
- ~~Evening transition is too abrupt~~ — fixed: 30-minute gradual lerp before winddown_start_hour
- ~~Evening wind-down triggers at fixed time regardless of activity~~ — fixed: delays 30 min and retries up to 4x if gaming/watching/social/working
- Mode detection has noticeable lag between activity start and mode switch

**Music:**
- ~~Mode-to-playlist mapping is too rigid~~ — fixed: vibe tagging supports multiple favorites per mode with energetic/focus/mellow/background/hype tags
- Auto-play is unreliable — sometimes doesn't trigger, sometimes plays when unwanted
- Sonos favorites are limiting — can't express "high energy electronic" as a vibe, only specific playlists
- Last.fm recommendations aren't useful — poor relevance to actual taste

**UI:**
- Too many taps for common actions — no quick shortcuts
- Visual design feels generic and unpolished — doesn't match the bold vision
- Hard to read at a glance — can't quickly parse what's happening without focusing
- Mobile experience is clunky — not optimized for touch or small screens
- Three-page layout (Home, Music, Settings) doesn't serve the command center vision

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **Two-process model:** Main server handles real-time control. Learning engine runs separately, reads events from the shared DB, computes patterns, and exposes an internal API for predictions. Main server queries the learning engine before making automation decisions.
- **Database migration path:** SQLite now → cloud PostgreSQL (Supabase free tier) when event volume grows. SQLAlchemy abstraction makes the switch straightforward. Event data uses 90-day rolling window with older data aggregated into daily/weekly summaries.
- **Frontend rewrite (shipped):** React 18 → SvelteKit + Threlte (Three.js). Parity-pass rewrite landed in commit `b96d062` as part of Phase 2a. Backend serves the static build via the `FRONTEND_BUILD` env var (default `frontend-svelte/build`), and the old React tree is kept in-tree as one-flag rollback insurance for one burn-in cycle before deletion.
- **PC Agent over network:** Gaming PC (wired ethernet) POSTs to laptop (WiFi). Same router, same subnet. Static IP or mDNS for discovery.
- **Alexa two-phase:** Fauxmo (local UPnP, free) for immediate voice control. Custom Alexa Skill + Cloudflare Tunnel for full flexibility later.

## Developer Guide

> **Audience:** This guide is primarily for Claude Code to follow when implementing new features. Patterns must be precise and consistent so automated code generation follows the established architecture.

### Pattern 1: Adding a Mode-Change Listener

The `AutomationEngine` exposes a callback system for reacting to mode changes. MusicMapper uses this for auto-play. GameDayEngine and FauxmoService will register the same way.

```python
# 1. Define an async callback in your service
async def on_mode_change(mode: str) -> None:
    """Called by AutomationEngine whenever the active mode changes.

    Args:
        mode: One of gaming, watching, working, social, idle, away, relax, movie, sleeping
    """
    if mode == "gaming":
        await do_something()

# 2. Register in main.py lifespan, AFTER automation engine is created
automation.register_on_mode_change(my_service.on_mode_change)
```

**Important:** Callbacks are async and called in registration order. Keep them fast — long-running work should be dispatched as background tasks.

### Pattern 2: Adding a New Backend Service

All services follow the same lifecycle pattern. Here's the complete template:

```python
# backend/services/new_service.py
import logging
from typing import Optional

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class NewService:
    """One-line description of what this service does."""

    def __init__(self, ws_manager, hue_service=None, sonos_service=None):
        """Accept only the dependencies this service actually needs."""
        self._ws_manager = ws_manager
        self._hue = hue_service
        self._connected = False

    @property
    def connected(self) -> bool:
        return self._connected

    async def connect(self) -> None:
        """Initialize connections. Called once during app lifespan startup."""
        try:
            # Setup logic here
            self._connected = True
            logger.info("NewService connected")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("NewService connection failed: %s", e, exc_info=True)
            self._connected = False

    async def poll_state_loop(self, ws_manager) -> None:
        """Background loop that polls for state changes and broadcasts via WebSocket.

        Only implement if this service needs to detect external changes.
        """
        while True:
            try:
                new_state = await self._check_state()
                if new_state != self._last_state:
                    await ws_manager.broadcast("new_service_update", new_state)
                    self._last_state = new_state
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error("NewService poll error: %s", e)
            await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Poll interval in seconds

    async def close(self) -> None:
        """Cleanup. Called during app lifespan shutdown."""
        self._connected = False
```

**Registration in `main.py` lifespan:**

```python
# In the lifespan() async context manager:

# 1. Create service
new_service = NewService(ws_manager=ws_manager, hue_service=hue_service)
await new_service.connect()
app.state.new_service = new_service

# 2. Start background poll (if applicable)
if new_service.connected:
    tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(new_service.poll_state_loop(ws_manager)))

# 3. Register mode-change callback (if applicable)
automation.register_on_mode_change(new_service.on_mode_change)
```

### Pattern 3: Adding API Routes

All routes go in `backend/api/routes/` as separate files per domain. Follow this template:

```python
# backend/api/routes/new_feature.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/new-feature", tags=["new-feature"])


class NewFeatureRequest(BaseModel):
    """Use Pydantic models for all request/response bodies."""
    name: str
    value: int


@router.get("/")
async def get_status(request: Request):
    """GET endpoints return current state."""
    service = request.app.state.new_service
    return {"status": "ok", "data": service.get_state()}


@router.post("/{id}/action")
async def perform_action(id: str, body: NewFeatureRequest, request: Request):
    """POST endpoints perform actions. Return result."""
    service = request.app.state.new_service
    result = await service.do_action(id, body.name, body.value)
    return {"status": "ok" if result else "error"}
```

**Registration in `main.py`:**
```python
from backend.api.routes.new_feature import router as new_feature_router
app.include_router(new_feature_router)
# MUST be registered BEFORE the frontend catch-all route
```

**Conventions:**
- Prefix: `/api/{domain}/`
- GET for reads, POST for actions, PUT for updates, DELETE for removals
- Always return `{"status": "ok"}` or `{"status": "error", "detail": "..."}`
- Access services via `request.app.state.{service_name}`
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation

### Pattern 4: Adding WebSocket Message Types

**Server → Client broadcast:**
```python
# In any service that needs to push updates:
await self._ws_manager.broadcast("new_event_type", {
    "key": "value",
    "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
})
```

**Client → Server handling in `main.py` WebSocket handler:**
```python
# In the websocket_endpoint function:
elif data["type"] == "new_command":
    result = await app.state.new_service.handle_command(data["data"])
    # Optionally broadcast result to all clients
    await ws_manager.broadcast("new_command_result", result)
```

**Naming convention:** `{domain}_{event}` — e.g., `light_update`, `sonos_update`, `game_update`, `learning_nudge`.

### Pattern 5: Adding an Activity Detector

Standalone scripts that POST mode changes. Can run on any machine on the LAN.

```python
# backend/services/pc_agent/new_detector.py
import requests
import time
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

SERVER_URL = "http://192.168.1.XXX:8000"  # Laptop IP
POLL_INTERVAL = 15  # seconds


def detect_mode() -> str:
    """Return detected mode or 'idle' if nothing detected."""
    # Detection logic here
    return "idle"


def main():
    while True:
        try:
            mode = detect_mode()
            requests.post(
                f"{SERVER_URL}/api/automation/activity",
                json={"mode": mode, "source": "new_detector"},
                timeout=5,
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Failed to report activity: %s", e)
        time.sleep(POLL_INTERVAL)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Mode priority (engine enforces automatically):** gaming (5) > social (4) > watching (3) > working (2) > idle (1) > away (0)

### Pattern 6: Adding a Scheduled Routine

```python
# 1. Create the routine service in backend/services/
class NewRoutineService:
    async def execute(self) -> bool:
        """Run the routine. Return True on success."""
        try:
            # Routine logic
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Routine failed: %s", e, exc_info=True)
            return False

# 2. Register in main.py lifespan:
from backend.services.scheduler import ScheduledTask

routine = NewRoutineService(sonos_service, tts_service)  # inject deps

task = ScheduledTask(
    name="new_routine",
    hour=12, minute=0,
    weekdays=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],  # Mon-Fri (0=Monday)
    callback=routine.execute,
    enabled=True,
)
scheduler.add_task(task)
```

**Conventions:**
- Routine configs persisted in `app_settings` table (key: `{routine_name}_config`)
- Always log execution to `routine_executions` table (via EventLogger)
- Expose test endpoint: `POST /api/routines/{name}/test`

### Pattern 7: Adding Light States for a New Mode

Define per-light states in `automation_engine.py` → `ACTIVITY_LIGHT_STATES`:

```python
"new_mode": {
    "day": {
        "1": {"on": True, "bri": 200, "hue": 15000, "sat": 100},
        "2": {"on": False},
        "3": {"on": True, "bri": 150, "hue": 8000, "sat": 150},
        "4": {"on": True, "bri": 150, "hue": 8000, "sat": 150},
    },
    "evening": {
        "1": {"on": True, "bri": 150, "hue": 8000, "sat": 150},
        # ... per-light states for evening
    },
    "night": {
        "1": {"on": True, "bri": 80, "hue": 5000, "sat": 200},
        # ... per-light states for night
    },
}
```

**How it works:** The engine combines time period (day/evening/night from schedule config) + current mode to look up per-light states. Each light ID maps to a specific physical light. Brightness multipliers from `mode_brightness` config are applied on top.

### Pattern 8: Adding Event Logging

All user-facing actions should be logged for the learning system. Use the EventLogger service:

```python
# In any route or service:
event_logger = request.app.state.event_logger

# Log a mode change
await event_logger.log_mode_change(
    mode="gaming",
    previous="idle",
    source="manual"  # or "process", "ambient", "alexa", "learned"
)

# Log a light adjustment
await event_logger.log_light_adjustment(
    light_id="1",
    state={"on": True, "bri": 200},
    trigger="manual"  # or "automation", "scene", "override"
)

# Log a user interaction
await event_logger.log_interaction(
    action="quick_action",
    detail={"action_name": "movie_night"},
    page="home"
)
```

**Convention:** Every POST/PUT route that changes state should log the action. The EventLogger buffers writes and flushes in batches.

### Pattern 9: Adding a Dashboard Widget for an External App

External apps expose a status endpoint. Home Hub polls it and displays the data as a widget card.

**Backend:**
```python
# Widget config stored in app_settings:
{
    "app": "plant",
    "status_url": "http://localhost:3001/api/status",
    "poll_interval_seconds": 300,  # 5 minutes
    "display": {
        "title": "Plants",
        "icon": "leaf",
        "link": "http://localhost:3001"
    }
}
```

The widget poller fetches status from each registered app and broadcasts via WebSocket:
```python
await ws_manager.broadcast("widget_data", {
    "app": "plant",
    "data": {"needs_water": 3, "healthy": 8, "next_care": "Water the fern"}
})
```

**Frontend (SvelteKit):**
Widget cards on the home page subscribe to `widget_data` WebSocket events and render app-specific cards with animated icons. Tapping opens the full external app in a new tab.

### Pattern 10: Adding an Animated Background (Threlte/Three.js)

Each mode has a scene component in `frontend-svelte/src/lib/backgrounds/`:

```
frontend-svelte/src/lib/backgrounds/
├── BackgroundManager.svelte    ← Switches scene based on current mode
├── GamingScene.svelte          ← High-energy particles, color shifts
├── RelaxScene.svelte           ← Arcade birds, warm ambient
├── SleepingScene.svelte        ← Moon + darkening city
├── WorkingScene.svelte         ← Minimal, subtle motion
├── SocialScene.svelte          ← Party energy, color cycling
├── GameDayScene.svelte         ← Colts themed, celebration bursts
└── DefaultScene.svelte         ← Fallback gradient
```

**Convention:**
- Each scene is a standalone Threlte component
- Receives `timeOfDay` prop (morning/day/evening/night) for time-based variations
- Receives `lightState` prop (current Hue colors) to match background to actual room lighting
- Animations run at 30fps max to keep laptop cool (always-on concern)
- Transitions between scenes use a fade-through-black (1s duration)

---

## Target Features

### Dashboard Redesign (Priority 1)

The current three-page layout is being replaced with a command center design:

- **Sidebar navigation** — Persistent sidebar with sections. Content area changes. Desktop app feel.
- **Widget-based home page** — Current mode (auto-updates), light state with live colors, now playing card, weather, next routine countdown, plant app status, bar app card
- **Animated mode backgrounds** — Bold, dynamic backgrounds per mode AND time of day:
  - *Gaming:* High-energy particles, vibrant color shifts matching light state
  - *Relax:* Arcade-style birds drifting across the screen, warm ambient feel
  - *Sleeping:* Dark theme, moon rotating based on real astronomical position (location-aware), city skyline growing darker
  - *Social:* Party energy, color cycling that mirrors the Hue effects
  - *Working:* Clean, minimal, focused — subtle motion only
  - *Game Day:* Colts blue/white, football-themed elements, celebration bursts on scoring plays
  - *Morning:* Sunrise gradient, warming colors
  - *Evening:* Warm sunset fade, gradual dimming
- **One-tap quick actions** — Movie night, bedtime, leaving, game day — each triggers a mode + light + music combo
- **Responsive layout** — Optimized for 1080p landscape (foldable laptop) AND mobile phone PWA
- **External project widgets** — Animated cards for plant app (live status: "3 plants need water") and bar app (recipe suggestion, hosting mode trigger). Widget + launcher pattern — show status, tap to open full app.

### Lighting Improvements

- **Gradual transitions** — Smooth brightness/color curves between time periods instead of hard switches
- **Activity-aware evening** — Wind-down starts gradually when idle in the evening, pauses if you're gaming/watching, resumes when idle again
- **Scene favorites** — Pin frequently-used scenes for quick one-tap access
- **Per-room mode overrides** — Let one room stay in a different mode (e.g., bedroom relaxed while living room is social)

### Display Auto-Switching (Monitor ↔ Projector)

**Status: spec only — deferred to Phase 1.5 / Phase 2. Not implemented.**

**Problem:** The desktop has two displays physically connected at all times — a DisplayPort monitor at native 2560x1440 (used for normal desktop work) and an HDMI projector at 1920x1080 (used in bed for movie/TV watching). Switching between them today is fully manual: turn projector on, switch its input to HDMI, turn the monitor off, then change the Windows display resolution by hand. The Windows resolution step is the part Home Hub can automate.

**Goal:** When `movie` mode activates, drop the projector display to 1920x1080 automatically. When leaving that mode, restore it to 2560x1440 (or whatever default was captured at startup).

**Architectural placement — desktop pc_agent, not in-process backend.** The projector is physically connected to the **desktop**, not the dashboard laptop where the FastAPI server runs. The Windows API call has to execute on the machine that owns the display, so this work belongs in a standalone pc_agent on the desktop — same pattern as `activity_detector.py`, `ambient_monitor.py`, and the upcoming `screen_sync_agent.py`. The agent polls `GET /api/automation/activity` and flips resolution locally on `movie` mode entry/exit. No new server endpoint needed.

**Feasibility — confirmed yes, no admin required.** Windows exposes `ChangeDisplaySettingsEx` (Win32) reachable from Python via `pywin32`. With the `CDS_UPDATEREGISTRY` flag, resolution changes are a per-user setting and do **not** require elevation. `EnumDisplayDevices` lets us target the projector specifically without touching the monitor. Both displays stay enumerable even when the monitor is physically powered off, since they're still electrically connected.

**Why not the alternatives:**
- **In-process backend service on the laptop** — Original spec recommended this, but the laptop server can't reach the desktop's display devices. Wrong architecture.
- **QRes / NirCmd / DisplaySwitch.exe** — external binaries, weaker per-display targeting, extra moving parts. Skip.
- **Separate elevated helper process** — unnecessary since admin isn't required. Adds complexity for no gain.
- **Switching the active display via Win+P / `DisplaySwitch.exe /external`** — out of scope. Anthony handles "which screen is on" physically (powering the monitor off, switching projector input). Resolution-only is the right scope.

**Recommended implementation (when this work starts):**

1. **New standalone agent** `backend/services/pc_agent/display_agent.py` following the `activity_detector.py` template. Runs on the desktop. Polls `GET /api/automation/activity` every ~5 seconds. On transitions into/out of `movie` mode, calls `win32api.ChangeDisplaySettingsEx` to swap projector resolution. Skips cleanly on non-Windows (`sys.platform != "win32"`).
2. **Identify displays by friendly name** (`DeviceString`, e.g., "Dell U2719D" / "BenQ HT2050A"), not by `\\.\DISPLAY1` / `\\.\DISPLAY2` — those aren't stable across driver reinstalls. Resolve friendly name → current device name at runtime.
3. **Snapshot the monitor's current refresh rate at agent startup** and restore it when leaving movie mode. Critical if the monitor runs >60 Hz, otherwise it'll silently drop.
4. **Trigger on `movie` mode only** (manual override) — **not** `watching`, since that auto-detects whenever VLC opens at the desk.
5. **No-op early-return** when already at target resolution to avoid double-flicker on repeated triggers.
6. **Force-restore on agent startup** in case the agent died while in projector mode and the monitor was left at 1080p. Config flag controls this.
7. **Local config file** in the agent's working directory (e.g., `display_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "monitor": {"friendly_name": "...", "default_width": 2560, "default_height": 1440, "default_refresh": null},
     "projector": {"friendly_name": "...", "default_width": 2560, "default_height": 1440, "movie_width": 1920, "movie_height": 1080, "refresh": 60},
     "trigger_mode": "movie",
     "restore_on_startup": true,
     "enabled": true
   }
   ```
   No server-side persistence needed — the agent owns its own state.
8. **Optional later:** a `POST /api/automation/display/notify` endpoint so the agent can push current resolution to the dashboard for display. Defer until the dashboard actually wants to show it.
9. **Dependencies:** `pywin32>=305` — added to a new `backend/services/pc_agent/requirements.txt` (desktop-only deps), not to the main backend requirements.

**Verification when built:**
- Run `python -m backend.services.pc_agent.display_agent` on the desktop → log shows current detected displays + friendly names.
- `POST /api/automation/override {"mode":"movie"}` (against the laptop server) → desktop agent picks up the change on next poll → projector flips to 1920x1080 within ~5s, monitor untouched. Reverse on switching back.
- Toggle movie mode twice in a row — confirm no second flicker (early-return path).
- Kill agent while in projector mode, restart — confirm restore-on-startup works.
- If monitor runs >60 Hz — confirm refresh rate is preserved across the round trip.

**Out of scope on purpose:** active-display switching, primary-display changes, multi-monitor topology rearrangement, per-application resolution profiles, anything non-Windows.

### Music Overhaul

- **Vibe-based mapping** — Replace single-favorite-per-mode with vibe tags per mode (e.g., gaming = "high energy, electronic, instrumental"). Multiple Sonos favorites tagged per vibe, system picks or rotates.
- **Smarter auto-play** — Fix reliability issues. Clear rules: play on mode change if idle AND auto-play enabled, never interrupt active listening unless told to.
- **Queue management** — View and reorder the Sonos play queue from the dashboard
- **Apple Music API integration** (future, $99/year) — Search catalog by genre/mood, build dynamic playlists, play via SoCo Apple Music URI support. Replaces manual favorite curation.
- **Better recommendations** — Improve relevance by weighting actual listening behavior over Last.fm similarity scores

### Intelligence & Learning System

The system observes everything and evolves from rules to autopilot:

**Data collection (new event tables):**
- `activity_events` — Mode transitions with timestamp, source, duration
- `light_adjustments` — All manual light changes (who changed what, when, in what mode)
- `sonos_playback_events` — What was played, how long, was it skipped
- `routine_executions` — When routines ran, success/failure, user overrides
- `user_interactions` — Dashboard actions, feature usage, page visits

**Phase 1 — Simple rules (quick wins):**
- Time + day patterns: "Friday 8pm usually means gaming mode"
- Override analysis: "You always override to relax at 9:30pm on weeknights"
- Auto-apply rules that have >90% historical accuracy

**Phase 2 — Pattern detection:**
- Correlate mode transitions with time, day-of-week, season
- Track which vibe/playlist choices stick vs get skipped
- Identify when automation gets it wrong (frequent manual overrides)

**Phase 3 — Full autopilot:**
- Proactive mode switching based on learned patterns
- Subtle nudge notifications: "Switching to relax mode" (brief toast, not interruptive)
- Self-adjusting schedules that evolve with behavior changes
- Learns from Alexa voice commands as another input signal

### Voice Control (Alexa)

**Phase 1 — Fauxmo (free, local, immediate):**
- Python library emulating WeMo devices on LAN
- Alexa discovers virtual devices: "gaming mode", "relax mode", "movie night"
- Each device calls the corresponding API endpoint (override, play favorite, activate scene)
- Sub-second latency, $0 cost, runs alongside the server
- Limitation: simple on/off per device, no parameters

**Phase 2 — Custom Alexa Skill + Cloudflare Tunnel:**
- Full flexibility: "Alexa, tell Home Hub to set gaming mode and play my playlist"
- AWS Lambda (~100 lines Python) → Cloudflare Tunnel (free) → local API
- Supports complex commands with parameters
- $0-5/month
- Every voice command logged as a learning signal for the intelligence system

### Game Day Engine

- **ESPN API integration** — Poll for live Colts game data (score, play-by-play, game state)
- **Play detection** — Identify touchdowns, field goals, big plays, turnovers, game start/end
- **Celebration orchestration** — Synchronized light shows + TTS on scoring plays (blue/white flash for TD, pulse for FG, alert for turnovers)
- **GameDay page** — Live score, game clock, down & distance, drive summary on the dashboard
- **Pixel art field** — Threlte/Three.js retro football field with animated sprites showing recent plays (consistent with the rest of the animation stack)
- **Pre-game mode** — Auto-activate Colts lighting and hype playlist before kickoff
- **Commercial break detection** — Dim celebration mode during breaks, re-engage on play resume

#### Game Day Architecture

```
ESPN API (polling) → GameDayEngine service
                      ├── game state tracking (score, quarter, possession)
                      ├── play detection (TD, FG, big play, turnover)
                      ├── CelebrationOrchestrator
                      │   ├── HueService.flash_lights() (blue/white sequences)
                      │   ├── HueV2Service.set_effect_all() (dynamic effects)
                      │   ├── TTSService.speak() ("Touchdown Colts!")
                      │   └── cooldown timer (prevent overlapping celebrations)
                      └── WebSocket broadcasts
                          ├── game_update (score, clock, drive)
                          ├── celebration (type, metadata)
                          └── game_status (active/inactive/upcoming)
```

New database tables:
- `game_schedule` — Upcoming Colts games (date, opponent, channel)
- `celebration_log` — History of triggered celebrations

Registers as a mode-change callback + runs its own ESPN polling loop. No changes to existing services needed.

### External Project Integration

- **Plant app widget** — Shows live status from the plant tracking web app (needs water count, next care action). Animated card on dashboard, taps to open full app.
- **Bar app widget** (future) — Recipe/inventory app. Widget shows tonight's cocktail suggestion based on current inventory. "Hosting mode" button sets mood lighting + playlist + shows recipe cards. Deeply tied to Home Hub for the hosting experience.

## Deployment

**Primary:** Dedicated foldable laptop (1080p, landscape), always-on, lid open on a shelf. Runs the FastAPI server and displays the dashboard in a full-screen browser.

**Secondary access:** Mobile phone (PWA), any browser on the local network.

**Server:** The laptop runs the Python backend + serves the SvelteKit frontend (static build). PC agent scripts run on the main gaming/work PC and POST activity updates to the laptop's server over LAN.

**Cloud services used:** OpenWeatherMap (weather), Google Maps (commute), Last.fm (music discovery), iTunes Search (previews), ESPN (future, game data). All are free-tier or low-cost APIs. Core features (lights, music, automation) work without internet.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Fix & Foundation (Now — April 2026)

- ✓ Fix automation timing: gradual evening transitions (30-min lerp before winddown_start_hour)
- ✓ Activity-aware wind-down: delays 30 min and retries up to 4x if gaming/watching/social/working
- ✓ Add vibe tagging to mode-playlist mapping (multiple favorites per mode with vibe column)
- ✓ Event logging tables live: activity_events, light_adjustments, sonos_playback_events + EventLogger service
- Fix music auto-play reliability
- Deploy server to dedicated laptop, confirm always-on stability

### Phase 2: Dashboard Redesign (May 2026)

- ✓ Sidebar navigation layout
- ✓ Widget-based home page (mode, lights, music, routines)
- ✓ Quick action buttons
- ✓ Mobile-responsive layout
- ✓ Sleeping-mode Threlte animated background (stack validator)
- ✓ SvelteKit + Threlte frontend rewrite (Phase 2a parity pass — commit `b96d062`)
- Remaining animated mode backgrounds (gaming, relax, default)
- Weather widget (OpenWeatherMap)
- External project widget cards (plant app)

### Phase 2a: Post-Cutover Cleanup (Pending burn-in)

The SvelteKit parity pass is live (commit `b96d062`) and backed by a
`FRONTEND_BUILD` env var in `backend/config.py` so the React tree stays
as one-flag rollback insurance. Before deleting the React build:

**Step 1 — Burn-in (one evening cycle):** Verify with the real
hardware across a full evening transition (ideally crossing the
~9 PM winddown ramp):

- Automation transitions fire on time; evening ramp smooth, no jumps
- Mode indicator + sidebar now-playing update within ~2s of Sonos
  changes triggered from another client (phone, Alexa)
- Sleeping-mode Threlte moon scene mounts full-bleed on sleep,
  unmounts on exit (GPU usage drops)
- Hue-app toggles reflect on the dashboard within ~1s
- No repeated reconnect banner

Rollback path if anything regresses: flip `FRONTEND_BUILD` in `.env`
back to `frontend/dist`, restart `python run.py`. No code revert.

**Step 2 — Re-add mode playlists:** `/api-audit` flagged all six
mode-playlist mappings as empty (not a regression, empty pre-cutover
too). Re-add via the Music page during burn-in so auto-play behavior
can also be exercised during the evening cycle.

**Step 3 — Cleanup commit(s):** Once burn-in passes cleanly:

- Delete `frontend/` (entire React tree)
- Delete `experiments/threlte-sleeping/` (MoonScene.svelte already
  copied into `frontend-svelte/src/lib/backgrounds/`)
- Drop the dead `/assets` mount branch in `backend/main.py:284-286`
  and update the "defaults to the React build" comment on line 278
- Flip `FRONTEND_BUILD` defaults in `.env.example` and
  `backend/config.py` from `frontend/dist` to `frontend-svelte/build`
- Update `CLAUDE.md`: Commands section (`cd frontend` →
  `cd frontend-svelte`), file-structure tree, and the architecture
  diagram's "Serves React static build" line

**Verification after cleanup:** `python run.py` starts without the
env var (new default kicks in), `/api-audit` + `/ui-audit` stay
green, `git grep "frontend/"` shows no stale backend/doc references.

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Voice (June 2026)

- Simple rule engine from collected event data
- Fauxmo Alexa integration (local voice control)
- Override pattern analysis + auto-apply confident rules
- Subtle nudge notification system

### Phase 4: Game Day (July-August 2026)

- ESPN API integration + game state polling
- GameDay page with live scoreboard
- Celebration orchestration (light flash + TTS)
- Game Day animated background
- Pixel art field with animated plays
- Pre-game mode automation
- Test during pre-season games

### Phase 5: Polish & Expand (September 2026+)

- Remaining animated backgrounds (all modes + time-of-day variants)
- Custom Alexa Skill (full voice control)
- Apple Music API integration ($99/year)
- Full autopilot learning from accumulated data
- Bar app widget integration
- Seasonal lighting adjustments
- Presence detection
- Guest mode

## Technical Limitations & Constraints

- **Hue bridge self-signed SSL** — httpx calls require `verify=False`. Cannot be changed.
- **Sonos UPnP** — No authentication, but also no encryption. LAN-only by design.
- **SoCo Apple Music support** — Can play individual tracks by URI (v0.26.0+), but cannot browse the Apple Music catalog. Browsing requires the $99/year Apple Music API.
- **Fauxmo device limits** — Each virtual device is simple on/off. Complex commands (set brightness to 50%) require the custom Alexa skill.
- **SQLite concurrency** — Single-writer. Fine for one user, but event logging at high frequency (every light poll) may need batching or a write queue.
- **Screen sync requires mss** — Only works on Windows. If the server moves to a headless Linux device, screen sync breaks.
- **Edge-tts requires internet** — TTS falls back to gTTS (also internet). No offline TTS option currently.
- **1080p landscape primary** — Animated backgrounds and layout designed for this resolution. Must degrade gracefully on mobile.
- **Indiana timezone** — America/Indiana/Indianapolis has unique DST rules. All scheduling must use this timezone explicitly.

## Non-Goals

- **Not a multi-user platform** — No auth, no user accounts, no multi-tenant support
- **Not a generic smart home hub** — No support for arbitrary device types, protocols, or brands beyond Hue and Sonos
- **Not a full smart home OS** — Not replacing Home Assistant, HomeKit, or SmartThings. This is a personal dashboard and automation layer.
- **Not an Alexa replacement** — Alexa handles general voice commands. Home Hub extends it for custom automation via Fauxmo/custom skill.
- **Not a sports app** — Game Day is for the Colts experience, not a general sports tracker
- **Not a music streaming service** — Sonos and Apple Music handle playback. Home Hub orchestrates what plays and when.
- **Not a music streaming service** — Sonos and Apple Music handle playback. Home Hub orchestrates what plays and when.
